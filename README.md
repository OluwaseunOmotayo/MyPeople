# MyPeople
Hackathon Project

People have been displaced from their country, from Afghans to Africans who left their homes for greener pastures. To fix this problem of struggling to adapt to new environments, we created My people.

## Story
Mission Statement: Creating cultural communities for migrants Motivation: This year alone, thousands of people have been displaced from their country. From Afghans to just Africans who left their homes for greener pastures. Most of these people end up in new countries alone and are unable to find people that look or think like them to help speed the adaptation process. It is a known fact that humans are social creatures, hence the need to socialize and eventually form cliques with similar beings. This need intensifies in situations when one seems to be the odd one out. To fix this problem of not belonging and struggling to adapt to new environments we create My people.
